# BERT Sentiment Analysis for Yelp Reviews

Description:

This repository houses an implementation of sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for the Yelp Reviews dataset. The project is centered around analyzing textual reviews from Yelp and discerning sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each review.

Key Features:

Utilizes the power of pre-trained BERT models fine-tuned for sentiment analysis tasks.
Preprocesses and tokenizes Yelp dataset reviews using the BERT tokenizer.
Fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on the Yelp Reviews dataset for sentiment prediction.
Evaluates the BERT model's performance using diverse metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Provides a comprehensive README with detailed guidelines for dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.
